### What is Core WCF? 

Core WCF is a port of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to .NET Core. The goal of this project is to enable existing WCF projects to move to .NET Core.

### Samples

This repo contains samples for how to use [CoreWCF](../CoreWCF/) in your projects. The best place to get started is [Basic / Binding / Basic / Http](Basic/Binding/Basic/Http).
