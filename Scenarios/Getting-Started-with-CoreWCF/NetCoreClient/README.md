# Getting started with Core WCF client sample

This is a sample makes manual calls endpoints with the BasicHttpBinding, WsHttpBinding & NetTcpBindings.

In many cases its probably better to create a client using the svcutil tool which will generate a strongly typed client based on the WSDL exposed for the EchoService. See [Walkthrough](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/blob/main/Documentation/Walkthrough.md) for an example of how to use the tool to generate a client.
