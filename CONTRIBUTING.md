# How to contribute

The easiest way to contribute is to open an issue and start a discussion.

Samples should be:
* Small and demonstrate a single concept
* Self contained - you should be able to copy the folder for the sample and not have to go hunting for helper classes
* Simple to follow
* Minimal dependencies - don't reference other nuget packages or frameworks if they are not critical to the functionality of the sample
* Paired for client and server, or supply any special instructions for creating a client using svc-util.
* Targeting the latest released version of CoreWCF
